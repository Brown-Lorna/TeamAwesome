TEAM PROJECT PROPOSAL

INSTRUCTIONS

Please prepare an executive summary of the group project you are
proposing. **Don’t forget to include each team member’s name (maximum of
three). **Your document need not be long, but it should look
professional and should clearly and concisely describe the project to be
developed. Please include the following sections (each should be roughly
one to two paragraphs):

1.  Overall project description. Describe the overall application.

2.  Mockups. Include a basic page mockup for the most critical pages
    (not more than three, but one may be sufficient).

3.  Third party APIs. Please list any APIs that will be used for this
    project including what data will be gathered from these APIs and
    what will be posted to them. Make sure to investigate these APIs as
    part of planning process to verify that you will be able to do the
    things that you want to do.

4.  Database (if applicable). Briefly describe any database entities
    that will be used by your application.

5.  Milestones. Your weekly assignments for the next five weeks will be
    portions of your project, as follows:

-   Week 9: Milestone 1

<!-- -->

-   Week 10: Milestone 2

<!-- -->

-   Week 11: Milestone 3

<!-- -->

-   Week 12: Project Demo, App Store Submission

<!-- -->

-   Final Week: App Store Ratings Final 

Please indicate what portions of the project you will have done for each
of the three weekly milestones. (You should list each one separately
along with the progress that will be in place).

In order to make sure you work through any deployment issues that may
arise (they always do!), as part of your milestone \#3 (Lesson 11),
include "Have a version of our application working at OpenShift" along
with any other goals you have for the week.

Each group member should submit a copy of their group’s proposal to
I-Learn.
