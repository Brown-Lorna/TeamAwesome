# MILESTONE THREE

## Complete and report on Milestone 3.

### Guidelines

For this week's assignment, please give a status report by doing the
following:

1\. List the members of your group and the title of your project.

2\. List what your Milestone was (e.g. from your proposal).

3\. Describe what you have done this week, and how it meets, falls short
of, or is different than your milestone, and why.

4\. Give a link to your application, and describe what I can do to see
evidence of your milestone (if possible).

5\. List plans for next week (and note if they are different than your
original milestone plans for next week).

6\. Submit your status report to I-Learn.

A few comments:

It is not necessarily bad if you have to change your milestones as you
get deeper into your projects, but each week you should be showing
evidence of good progress toward your project completion.

I also recognize it is not always possible for you to submit evidence
for a milestone, but try to include something where possible.
