**Project Description Overview**

The web application will let a user create an account. A logged in user
will have access to images suitable for holiday greetings in the
database. Users can log in to Facebook through our application if they
want to submit an image from our database. They can select a stored
image and submit the image to their Facebook page through the
application. Optionally, a user can upload a new image to the database
for use by all logged in users.
